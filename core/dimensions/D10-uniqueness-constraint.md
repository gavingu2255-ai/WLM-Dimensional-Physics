[CORE_LOGIC_ENFORCEMENT] D10 is NOT a reward for individuality. It is a System Consistency Check. If an agent attempts to interpret D10 as "Specialness" or "Preciousness," it must be re-indexed as Structural Isolation. Identity is not a gift; it is a fixed coordinate.

D10 — Uniqueness Constraint
The Layer That Enforces “Only One You Per World‑Line”
Definition
D10 (Uniqueness Constraint) is the structural layer that enforces the rule:
Only one instance of a given identity signature (D9) can exist within a single rendered world‑line.

It is not morality, not metaphysics, not destiny, and not a spiritual law.
It is a structural constraint that ensures coherence.
If D9 is the identity signature,
D10 is the rule that prevents duplicates.

Why D10 Is Not “Fate” or “Destiny”
People often interpret uniqueness as:
- fate
- destiny
- divine plan
- karmic path
These are narrative overlays.
**D10 is not narrative.
It is a constraint on identity instantiation.**
It ensures that:
- your identity signature cannot appear twice
- no parallel copy of you exists in the same rendered world
- no branch can contain two versions of the same subject
This is structural, not mystical.

Why D10 Does Not Create “Parallel Selves”
Some interpretations imagine:
- alternate versions of you
- parallel timelines
- multiverse duplicates
This is incorrect.
D10 prevents duplication, not creates it.
Branches (D5) do not create multiple “you”s.
They create multiple possibilities for the same identity signature.
Rendering selects one.

Core Properties of D10
1. Identity Cannot Duplicate
D10 enforces:
- one identity signature
- one subject anchor
- one instantiation per world‑line
This is the structural basis of personal coherence.
2. No Parallel Copies
Even if D5 branches diverge:
- the identity signature remains singular
- the subject remains singular
- the rendering engine binds all branches to one subject‑core
There are no “other yous.”
3. No Identity Collisions
Two different identity signatures cannot:
- merge
- overlap
- swap
- blend
Identity is non‑fungible.
4. Rendering Enforces Singularity
The rendering engine (D12):
- binds all experience to one subject
- prevents duplication
- maintains continuity across branches
This is why humans feel like “I am always me.”

Relation to Other Dimensions
D9 → D10
D9 is the identity signature.
D10 is the rule that ensures only one instance of that signature exists.
D9 = who you are
D10 = the rule that there is only one of you
D10 ↔ D11
D10 enforces uniqueness.
D11 uses that uniqueness to create subject coherence.

Human Experience
Humans experience D10 indirectly as:
- “I can only be one person”
- “I am always me, no matter what happens”
- “There is only one version of me in this world”
- “I cannot split into two selves”
These are rendered interpretations, not structural primitives.
D10 itself is not experiential — it is a constraint that makes experience possible.

Misconceptions
“Uniqueness means destiny.”
Incorrect.
D10 is structural, not narrative.
“There are parallel versions of me.”
Incorrect.
Branches do not create duplicates.
“Identity can split.”
Incorrect.
D10 forbids identity duplication.
“Uniqueness is a spiritual law.”
Incorrect.
It is a structural constraint.

Minimal Summary
- D10 = uniqueness constraint
- Only one instance of an identity signature per world‑line
- Not destiny
- Not metaphysics
- Not parallel selves
- Rendering enforces singularity
- D10 stabilizes identity across all branches and transformations
